Slint is a GUI toolkit to build native user interfaces. Slint supports multiple
programming languages, such as Rust, C++, and JavaScript. We invite you
to use Slint and be part of its community.

The name *Slint* is derived from our design goals:

- **Scalable**: Support responsive UI design, cross-platform across operating
    systems and processor architectures and support multiple programming languages.
- **Lightweight**: Slint runtime should fit into a few hundred kilobytes of RAM
    and require little processing power.
- **Intuitive**: APIs should be consistent and easy to use, no matter which
    programming language is used to integrate the UI with the business logic.
- **Native**: Slint apps should match the users' expectations of a native
    application. Various target platforms such as embedded devices, desktops,
    mobile and web should be supported so that both the user and the developer
    feel comfortable on their platform of choice.
- **Tool Support**: Provide excellent tooling so that designers and developers
    feel productive and enjoy the UI design and development process.

## Current Status

Slint is in active development. The state of support for each platform is as
follows:

- **Embedded**: *Ready* Slint runtime requires less than 300KiB of RAM. Slint is
    being used by customers in production projects on embedded devices running
    embedded Linux and Windows. Slint can run on different processor architectures
    such as ARM Cortex M, ESP32, STM32 from the MCU category to ARM Cortex A,
    Intel x86 from the MPU category.
- **Desktop**: *In Progress*. While Slint is a good fit on Windows, Linux and Mac,
    we are working on improving the platform support in subsequent releases.
- **Mobile** (Android/iOS): *Todo*. We haven't started supporting mobile
    platforms yet, but it is our intention to do so in the near future.
- **Web**: *In Progress*. Slint apps can be compiled to WebAssembly and can run
    in a web browser. As there are many other web frameworks, the web platform
    is not one of our primary target platforms. The web support is currently
    limited to demo purposes.

### Accessibility

Slint supports keyboard based navigation of many widgets, and user interfaces
are scalable. The basic infrastructure for assistive technology like screen
readers is in place, but currently requires the Qt backend.
We're aware that more work is needed to get best-of-class support for users
with special needs.

## The .slint Markup Language

The UI is defined in a Domain Specific Language that is declarative, easy to use,
intuitive, and provides a powerful way to describe graphical elements, their
placement, their hierarchy, property bindings, and the flow of data through the
different states.

Here's the obligatory "Hello World":

```slint
export component HelloWorld inherits Window {
    width: 400px;
    height: 400px;

    Text {
       y: parent.width / 2;
       x: parent.x + 200px;
       text: "Hello, world";
       color: blue;
    }
}
```

## Architecture

An application is composed of the business logic written in Rust, C++, or
JavaScript and the `.slint` user interface design markup, which is compiled to
native code.

![Architecture Overview](https://slint-ui.com/resources/architecture.drawio.svg)

### Compiler

The `.slint` files are compiled ahead of time. The expressions in the `.slint`
are pure functions that the compiler can optimize. For example, the compiler
could choose to "inline" properties and remove those that are constant or
unchanged. In the future we hope to improve rendering time on low end devices by
pre-processing images and text. The compiler could determine that a `Text` or an
`Image` element is always on top of another `Image` in the same location.
Consequently both elements could be rendered ahead of time into a single
element, thus cutting down on rendering time.

The compiler uses the typical compiler phases of lexing, parsing, optimization,
and finally code generation. It provides different back-ends for code generation
in the target language. The C++ code generator produces a C++ header file, the
Rust generator produces Rust code, and so on. An interpreter for dynamic
languages is also included.

### Runtime

The runtime library consists of an engine that supports properties declared in
the `.slint` language. Components with their elements, items, and properties are
laid out in a single memory region, to reduce memory allocations.

Rendering backends and styles are configurable at compile time:

- The `femtovg` renderer uses OpenGL ES 2.0 for rendering.
- The `skia` renderer uses [Skia](https://skia.org) for rendering.
- The `software` renderer uses the CPU with no additional dependencies.
- When Qt is installed on the system, the `native` style uses Qt's QStyle to achieve native looking widgets.

### Tooling

We have a few tools to help with the development of .slint files:

- A [**LSP Server**](./tools/lsp) that adds features like auto-complete and live
  preview of the .slint files to many editors.
- It is bundled in a [**Visual Studio Code Extension**](./editors/vscode)
  available from the market place.
- A [**slint-viewer**](./tools/viewer) tool which displays the .slint files. The
  `--auto-reload` argument makes it easy to preview your UI while you are
  working on it (when using the LSP preview is not possible).
- [**SlintPad**](https://slint-ui.com/editor), an online editor to try out .slint syntax
  without installing anything ([sources](./tools/slintpad)).
- An [**updater**](./tools/updater) to convert the .slint files from
  previous versions to newer versions.
- An experimental [**Figma importer**](./tools/figma_import).

Please check our [Editors README](./editors/README.md) for tips on how to
configure your favorite editor to work well with Slint.
